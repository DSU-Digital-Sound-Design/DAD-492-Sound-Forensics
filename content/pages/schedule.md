      * Make sure you have turned in both the cleaned up audio recording AND the spectrogram screenshot.
      * Exporting files
      * Loop playback 
      * The transient of any sound is the most important to take away, make sure you don't forget it. 
  
   In class: Use the lasso and auto heal selection tools to remove that pesky crow in [this](https://freesound.org/people/dobroide/sounds/580486/) recording. 
   * Select each partial with the lasso tool 
   * then auto heal the selection using command+U
   * use the attenuation knob if necessary
   * again export the file and upload to d2l with a screenshot of the spectrogram.

   HOMEWORK:
   **Read** Chapter 3 History of Audio Forensics from Robert C. Maher's Principles of Forensic Audio Analysis. Write a short summary of each of the cases. 
   
   **Listen and respond** to [Twenty Thousand Hertz - Sound Forensics Podcast](https://www.20k.org/episodes/forensicaudio) which covers some recent cases where audio forensics was used as an important tool.

   In Class work: 
   * [Analyze, Normalize, Process](pages/lectures/week-3/lab-instructions)
   * Remove the noise from 3 recordings with broadband constant noise. 
   * HINT: you may need to do the noise reduction multiple times to get different bands of noise. 
      * [Birds and bells](https://freesound.org/people/arnaud%20coutancier/sounds/436032/)
      * [Bagpipes](https://freesound.org/people/Puniho/sounds/172687/) - clean this up as well as you can
      * [Field recording](https://freesound.org/people/833-45/sounds/11727/) - Only remove the hum from the power lines
         * Don't use the deHummer, see how well you can do with just the noise reduction. 
         * Hint: you can zoom in on the frequency display to only find the range of the hum. Try to look up what the hum is in Canada. 
         * Use this [calculator](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-harmonics.htm) to find the odd harmonics of the hum.

   **In class lab: Sound Remover Tool**

  Remove the cough from the interview, it is really difficult but try several options. Remove the hum from the guitar playing. Remove the rude cell phone ringing during the piano performance. This tool is really useful for removing dynamic prominent sounds. Be sure to look at the presets for help with removing different sounds within different contexts.

   Project 4 Due 10/12: 
   1. Create an audio recording with your phone with less than ideal recording conditions. Remember all the different things that can effect the intelligibility of a recording such as other people talking, broadband noise, excessive reverb, strange encodings, or clipping distortion. Include multiple examples to make your recording difficult to understand. Pick a paragraph of text to read from a poem or popular song. This recording will be randomly shared with another classmate. 
   2. Partner up with a classmate and have them email you their recording. Use the tools we have been learning to clean up the recording and make the speech as intelligible as you can. 
   3. Produce a transcript of the speech.

   ## More gunshot acoustics 

   **Tuesday 10/19**

   * Finish analysis of [Vegas shooting](pages/lectures/week-9/vegas-shooting-lab)

   **Thursday 10/21**

   * Analysis of 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers
      * Using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMX9Cz_W8kw) try to answer the question of how many high powered weapon (rifle) gunshots were there and how many other gunshots were there? Remember the acoustics of a high powered rifle that should tell you which sound is which. 
      * The recording may require some editing to remove the background noise. This is up to you whether you think it needs it or not. 
      * In Sonic Visualizer create a layer for each type of weapon and rename it to the weapon type.
      * Produce three charts showing the shockwave, muzzle blast, and lagtime data for each rifle gunshot. 
      * For the non rifle gunshots just do a muzzle blast chart. 
      * Use the same form as the last lab. This example is much more challenging because the gunfire is happening closer to buildings creating more reflections that obscure the sonic wave.

   <!-- HOMEWORK: Read `Shooter Localization Using Social Media Videos` and summarize its findings. What problems does it solve? What methods does it use to solve them?  -->
  
   <!-- * Analysis of gunshot caught by ring doorbell camera  -->

   Part 2 – Take one of your classmates’ recordings and enhance it to have a high degree of intelligibility.

   * Complete the [Visible Vowels tutorial](https://fryske-akademy.nl/fa-apps/tutorial/)

   **Thursday 11/18**

   * Adding new data to visible vowels
   * This time [use this chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio) to listen for the correct vowels then enter them into Praat. This will provide for a more more accurate vowel chart.
   * Or use this [text to IPA](https://tophonetics.com/) translator. 
   * Tutorial - [Extracting formants in Praat](https://joeystanley.com/downloads/191002-formant_extraction)
      * Complete this tutorial to learn about Praat scripting and how to format your data to be used for different purposes. This is important because Visible Vowels is looking for a very specific format for its data. 
      * You may want to write you code in an IDE to make it easier to read. My IDE of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you save the code in your IDE you can then reopen it from disk in Praat by clicking File > Reopen from disk or shift+command+O. You can run the code with command+R. 
   * After you finish with this tutorial add the columns that are needed for visible vowels. See the formatting [here](https://www.visiblevowels.org/#help). 
      * Some [tips](pages/lectures/week-13/formatting-data-visible-vowels) for completing this part. 
   * Open up your csv file in a Google Sheets and save it as xlsx. 
   * Upload your data to [visible vowels](https://www.visiblevowels.org) and redo the tutorial.
