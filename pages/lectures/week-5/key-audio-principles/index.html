The HVAC system in a professional studio will be inaudible, to not get captured on the recording. The attitude of a professional studio is to not &ldquo;fix it in the mix&rdquo; but to get the best result from the start</li><li>Forensic audio is the opposite of this, we have no control over the capture environment, and we have to &ldquo;fix it in the mix&rdquo;</li><li>common examples include recordings made in venues containing crowds of people talking and loud background music, recordings made by emergency call centre systems of some form of violent altercation (often containing shouting, sirens, screaming, and subsequently clipping) and recordings captured two rooms away from the related event.</li></ul><h2 id=equipment>Equipment</h2><ul><li>can capture multiple inputs simultaneously</li><li>racks of processing units for reverb, compressors, equalizers</li><li>while its easy to add these effects to an unprocessed sound, its quiet difficult to take it away.
