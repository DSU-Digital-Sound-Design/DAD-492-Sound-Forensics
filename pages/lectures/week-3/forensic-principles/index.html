The expert giving their opinion must be able to show their qualifications in the field of their expertise. The experts must also show that they are unbiased.</p><p>If questions are raised to the authenticity of evidentiary recordings, the burden is on the party raising the question to provide evidence as to their reason for concern.</p></aside></section><section><h2 id=authentic-recording---the-audio-engineering-society-2012>Authentic recording - The Audio Engineering Society (2012)</h2><blockquote><p>made simultaneously with the acoustic events it purports to have recorded, made in a manner fully and completely consistent with the methods of recording claimed by the party who produced the recording and free from unexplained artifacts, alterations, additions, deletions or edits.</p></blockquote><aside class=notes><p>If another party can show any variance from this definition, the evidence is not authentic and so not admissable.</p><p>Not admissable:</p><ul><li>not an exact bit-for-bit copy of the original recording</li><li>recording with edits, this leads to a &lsquo;framing bias&rsquo; where only the material beneficial to one party is submitted</li></ul></section><section><h2 id=best-practices>Best Practices</h2><ul><li>documents published by departments in government, committees in international standards organizations, and scientific working groups (groups of scientists from a specific field).</li><li><a href=https://www.swgde.org/documents/draft-released-for-comment rel=noopener>Draft examples</a></li></ul><aside class=notes><p>These give forensic scientists a common point of reference when they are looking at evidence to help them negate issues with admissability.
