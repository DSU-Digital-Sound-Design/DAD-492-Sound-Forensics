Before updates are performed, a review of the reason for the update should be performed, and verification testing completed to ensure the software functions as expected before its application to casework.
A list of all software versions and the dates of updates must also be documented to ensure only those which have been validated and verified are used, and periodic verification is performed based on the dates stored within the log.</p></section><section><h2 id=audio-equipment>Audio Equipment</h2><ul><li>Headphones</li><li>Audio interface</li></ul><aside class=notes><p>First, the headphones. Closed-back, over-the-ear designs trap the sound output from the headphones, prevent external sounds from entering the ear canal, and prevent reverberation, all of which reduce the possibility of any misrepresentation of the audio output due to the acoustics of the listening environment. This is essential for ensuring tasks such as critical listening and transcribing can be performed in optimal conditions. A built-in limiter would also be desirable to prevent loud transients which have the potential to damage hearing, and the frequency response should be as flat as possible to avoid regions being attenuated and boosted which may colour the sound (Bergfeld and Junte, 2017). It is better to control the frequency response by using a pair with a flat frequency response and apply boosts and cuts from within the workstation than listen to a signal which has a frequency response coloured by the speakers. Most headphones designed for commercial use by the general public will not have a flat frequency response as their primary task is to sound ‘good,’ which means their representation of the material is not necessarily accurate.</p><p>Second, a sound interface with a number of inputs and high-quality ADC and DAC converters. Conversion to the digital domain is required in instances where there is no digital access to recordings stored on a device, and so an analogue signal must be sent to an input on the interface. This is becoming less of a necessity as devices with various digital interfacing options, such as removable memory cards, wi-fi connections, and direct cable transfer become more common. Capture through analogue means is not ideal, but does happen on occasion. The interface similarly requires a high-quality DAC for output to the headphones.</p></section><section><h2 id=other-devices>Other Devices</h2><ul><li>Hardware write-blocker</li><li>Portable audio recorders</li><li>Cassette tape player</li><li>External hard drives</li><li>Printer</li><li>DVD reader/writer</li><li>SD card reader</li></ul><aside class=notes><ul><li>Hardware write-blocker.

Notes are then made by the reviewer, either digitally or physically, and provided for the examiner to consider before amending the original report where necessary. These considerations will range from terminology and grammar, the analysis performed, conclusions reached, and any legal necessities in relation to the work performed.</li><li>Although this may seem like a lot of documentation, there are methods to reduce it while still ensuring the same level of detail and thus, reliability. One example with regards to audio enhancements is to export the settings and processes applied from the software used. Not all programs include this feature, but if available, it is an option as it is simple and effective in ensuring the processes applied are documented accurately.</li></ul></li></ul></aside></aside></aside></aside></aside></aside></aside></aside></section></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=../../../../reveal-hugo/object-assign.js></script><a href=../../../../reveal-js/css/print/ id=print-location style=display:none></a><script type=text/javascript>var printLocationElement=document.getElementById('print-location'),link=document.createElement('link');link.rel='stylesheet',link.type='text/css',link.href=printLocationElement.href+(window.location.search.match(/print-pdf/gi)?'pdf.css':'paper.css'),document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(link)</script><script type=application/json id=reveal-hugo-site-params>null</script><script type=application/json id=reveal-hugo-page-params>{"theme":"solarized"}</script><script src=../../../../reveal-js/js/reveal.js></script><script type=text/javascript>var revealHugoDefaults,revealHugoSiteParams,revealHugoPageParams,options;function camelize(a){return a&&Object.keys(a).forEach(function(b){newK=b.replace(/(\_\w)/g,function(a){return a[1].toUpperCase()}),newK!=b&&(a[newK]=a[b],delete a[b])}),a}revealHugoDefaults={center:!0,controls:!0,history:!0,progress:!0,transition:"slide"},revealHugoSiteParams=JSON.parse(document.getElementById('reveal-hugo-site-params').innerHTML),revealHugoPageParams=JSON.parse(document.getElementById('reveal-hugo-page-params').innerHTML),options=Object.assign({},camelize(revealHugoDefaults),camelize(revealHugoSiteParams),camelize(revealHugoPageParams)),Reveal.initialize(options)</script><script type=text/javascript src=../../../../reveal-js/plugin/markdown/marked.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=../../../../reveal-js/plugin/markdown/markdown.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=../../../../reveal-js/plugin/highlight/highlight.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=../../../../reveal-js/plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=../../../../reveal-js/plugin/notes/notes.js></script></body></html>
