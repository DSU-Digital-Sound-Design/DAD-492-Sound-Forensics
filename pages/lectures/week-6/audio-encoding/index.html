During the encoding stage, the raw audio data is processed by an algorithm to reduce the size of the data and thus aid in smaller file sizes.</p><p>When an audio file is saved within a file system, the encoded audio data (the stream/payload) is stored within a container or wrapper, with a filename extension associated with the container. The filename extension is used by the operating system to determine the software required to read the structure of the file and play the recording. The container holds information in relation to the codec used to encode the data (and thus the codec required to decode the data), information required by the decoder to decode the data and all metadata associated with the file (Figure 6.1). The file itself does not contain any form of codec. MP3 encoded files do not require a file container.</p></section><section><h2 id=codec-lab---ffmpeg-in-audacity>Codec lab - FFmpeg in audacity</h2><ul><li>Using Audacity<ul><li>preferences -> FFmpeg library -> Download</li><li>then follow the instructions to download and locate the FFmpeg library</li><li>Once it&rsquo;s located you can now export in many different formats and codecs</li><li>Export an audio file and under file type choose &ldquo;Custom FFmpeg export&rdquo;</li><li>click &ldquo;open custom FFmpeg format options&rdquo;, choose 3 different codecs and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;</li><li>make sure that it works, open it in Audacity, view the metadata by clicking edit -> metadata to see if you changed the codec</li><li>if Audacity doesn&rsquo;t show you the codec try VLC.

In these recordings, the quantised sample values are, therefore, stored as integers within the payload section of a file.</p><p>Each sample represents a ‘sample point.’ Within stereo recordings, the samples pertaining to the left and right channels (which are replayed simultaneously on playback) are classed as ‘sample frames.’ The sample frame for mono recordings is a single sample point.</p><p>Regardless of the bit-depth, the samples are stored linearly, but there are differences between their representation when quantised to 8 bits as opposed to 9 bits or above. 8-bit quantisation values are stored as unsigned integers (so no polarity sign such as plus or minus), with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 255.</p></section><section><h2 id=compressed-audio>Compressed audio</h2><img src=shannon.jpg width=60%><aside class=notes><p>Although the previously described formats encode audio in a manner which results in an accurate representation of the analogue signal at capture, the amount of data required to store such information can be substantial. In order to reduce the file size, and thus increase the capacity for storage and transmission, a technique known as compression is used. The theory behind this method was first proposed by C.E. Shannon in 1948, in which the limitations of data compression without losing any quality (otherwise known as lossless compression) were demonstrated. It was also proposed that codes could be used to compress information, in what is commonly referred to as Shannon Entropy. Lossless compression reduces the file size for storage during the encoding stage, but, upon decoding, the file is reconstructed without any data loss.</p><p>Lossy compression reduces the file size as above, but upon decoding, any data removed during encoding is not recovered. This results in a degree of quality degradation, the tolerance of which is based on the codec used and the settings of such. It is performed through various processes which take advantage of areas of deficiency in the human auditory system, such as critical masking and bandwidth reduction. Lossy compression produces the smallest audio file sizes available, thus explaining its popularity with streaming services and applications where storage is at a premium.</p></section><section><h2 id=perceptual-encoding>Perceptual Encoding</h2><blockquote><p>the process of encoding which take advantage of the theory that humans cannot perceive all of the data being produced on playback of PCM recordings</p></blockquote><aside class=notes><ul><li>the process of encoding which take advantage of the theory that humans cannot perceive all of the data being produced on playback of PCM recordings</li><li>removes frequencies that we can&rsquo;t perceive, and thus reduces the amount of data required to store<ul><li>below 20 Hz or above 20 kHz</li></ul></li><li>also removes frequencies that are masked - either simultaneous or non-simultaneous</li></ul></section><section><h2 id=perceptual-encoding-and-decoding>Perceptual encoding and decoding</h2><img src=codec.png width=70%></section><section><h2 id=mp3-fka-mpeg-1-audio-layer-3>Mp3 (FKA Mpeg-1 Audio Layer 3)</h2><img src=ipod.jpg width=70%><aside class=notes><ul><li>Many of the files you work with will be compressed.
