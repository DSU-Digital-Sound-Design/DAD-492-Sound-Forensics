## Remove consistent noise 

* Make sure the amplitude statistics window is visible. Select all of your audio and then click the scan button. Now you can see the amplitude statistics for the audio. This will tell you how much headroom there is for normalization. Clicking on the icon next to each dB reading will jump you to that position in the audio. 
* Next, normalize the audio recording to -3 dB. This is important so that the noise is more audible. This makes it easier to remove.  
* Capture a noise print by selecting only the frequency range where the noise exists. 
* Open the noise reduction effect and choose parameters that match your need. 
* See the details for the available parameters [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/noise-reduction-restoration-effects.html#noise_reduction_effect_waveform_editor_only). Read through those parameters choosing the ones that work the best for each audio recording.
