   **Tuesday 8/24:**

   * Me - [Dr. Carson](https://tatecarson.com)
   * Class introductions 
      * Name? Class year? Where are you from? Any idea what forensic audio is?
   * [Syllabus](pages/syllabus.md)
   * [Perusall](https://perusall.com/) signup
        * I will assign readings, videos, or podcasts through Perusall. You will highlight interesting or confusing parts of the material and ask questions. These assignments will be part of your participation grade.  
        * Course code - **CARSON-6A22R**
        * Do the syllabus highlighting by next class.   
   * [Intro to forensics](pages/lectures/week-1/introduction/)   

   Homework: Listen to the Sound Matters Audio Forensics podcast episode and post at least three questions or comments in Perusall.

   **Thursday 8/26**

   * [Sound Matters: 26 - Audio Forensics](pages/lectures/week-1/introduction-to-forensic-audio/sound-matters-summary.md) - [slides](pages/lectures/week-1/introduction-to-forensic-audio/)
   * Lab: Introduction to Adobe Audition. Download a soundfile from freesound.org and open it in Audition. Use the marquee selection tool to emphasize and de-emphasize parts of the sound.

   The history of audio forensics

   **Tuesday 8/31**

   * [slides](pages/lectures/week-2/history-of-audio-forensics/) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-2/history-of-audio-forensics/forensic-audio.pdf)
   * Adobe Audition Lab:
      * [Learn how to make selections using the Time Selection, Marquee Selection, and Lasso Selection tools in Audition to edit audio precisely and add effects. ](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/how-to/audition-make-selections-editing-cc.html?playlist=/services/playlist.helpx/products:SG_AUDITION_1_1/learn-path:get-started/set-header:ccx-designer/playlist:basictraining/en_us.json)
      * [Remove beeps, hisses, and other noise by visually editing waveforms with Spectral Frequency Display in Adobe Audition.](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/how-to/audition-spectral-frequency-display-cc.html?playlist=/services/playlist.helpx/products:SG_AUDITION_1_1/learn-path:get-started/set-header:ccx-designer/playlist:basictraining/en_us.json)
      * Download [this sound file](https://freesound.org/people/arnaud%20coutancier/sounds/436032/) and remove the first three bells with the marquee selection tool. Post your resulting audio file and a screenshot of the spectrogram to d2l. 

   **Thursday 9/2**

    
   * [Audio forensics beginnings](pages/lectures/week-2/audio-forensic-beginnings/) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-2/audio-forensic-beginnings/forensic-audio-history.pdf)

   Adobe Audition Lab:
   * Review from Tuesday 8/31
      * Make sure you have turned in both the cleaned up audio recording AND the spectrogram screenshot.
      * Exporting files
      * Loop playback 
      * The transient of any sound is the most important to take away, make sure you don't forget it. 
  
   In class: Use the lasso and auto heal selection tools to remove that pesky crow in [this](https://freesound.org/people/dobroide/sounds/580486/) recording. 
   * Select each partial with the lasso tool 
   * then auto heal the selection using command+U
   * use the attenuation knob if necessary
   * again export the file and upload to d2l with a screenshot of the spectrogram.

   HOMEWORK:
   **Read** Chapter 3 History of Audio Forensics from Robert C. Maher's Principles of Forensic Audio Analysis. Write a short summary of each of the cases. 
   
   **Listen and respond** to [Twenty Thousand Hertz - Sound Forensics Podcast](https://www.20k.org/episodes/forensicaudio) which covers some recent cases where audio forensics was used as an important tool.

   Forensic principles

   **Tuesday 9/7**

   * [Review important cases that used audio forensics](pages/lectures/week-3/historical-cases) 
   * [Twenty Thousand Hertz - Forensic Audio](pages/lectures/week-3/twenty-thousand-hertz)
   * [Forensic Principles slides](pages/lectures/week-3/forensic-principles) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-3/forensic-principles/forensic-principles.pdf)
       

   In Class work: 
   * [Analyze, Normalize, Process](pages/lectures/week-3/lab-instructions)
   * Remove the noise from 3 recordings with broadband constant noise. 
   * HINT: you may need to do the noise reduction multiple times to get different bands of noise. 
      * [Birds and bells](https://freesound.org/people/arnaud%20coutancier/sounds/436032/)
      * [Bagpipes](https://freesound.org/people/Puniho/sounds/172687/) - clean this up as well as you can
      * [Field recording](https://freesound.org/people/833-45/sounds/11727/) - Only remove the hum from the power lines
         * Don't use the deHummer, see how well you can do with just the noise reduction. 
         * Hint: you can zoom in on the frequency display to only find the range of the hum. Try to look up what the hum is in Canada. 
         * Use this [calculator](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-harmonics.htm) to find the odd harmonics of the hum.

   HOMEWORK: 
   
   Read and respond to [This Man Spent Nearly A Year In Prison Over Erroneous AI-Based Evidence](https://hothardware.com/news/man-jailed-over-ai-powered-gunshot-detection)
 

   **Thursday 9/9**

   * Review erroneous AI evidence article 
      * See this more detailed [article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-shotspotter-chicago-man-jailed-20210820-krlg7y2gt5gwxozolqvvslsni4-story.html) from Chicago Tribune
   * [Bias mitigation](pages/lectures/week-3/bias-etc) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-3/bias-etc/sop.pdf)


   **In class lab: Sound Remover Tool**

  Remove the cough from the interview, it is really difficult but try several options. Remove the hum from the guitar playing. Remove the rude cell phone ringing during the piano performance. This tool is really useful for removing dynamic prominent sounds. Be sure to look at the presets for help with removing different sounds within different contexts.

   In class lab: 
   * Find recorded examples of different type of masking including temporal masking, informational masking and non-temporal masking. Along with your recordings explain each of the phenomena. You may use the textbook (Digital Audio Forensics Fundamentals by James Zjalic) to help with your explanation of masking.

Project 5: Part 1 – Create an audio recording with your phone with less than ideal recording conditions. I will provide text for you to read. This recording will be randomly shared with another classmate. 
<p>
Part 2 – Take one of your classmates’ recordings and enhance it to have a high degree of intelligibility.
<p>
 
   Possible enhancement technique: Kent Gibson removed a blaring tv from a recording of people talking by obtaining the actual TV broadcast and inverting the phase of the broadcast recording.
