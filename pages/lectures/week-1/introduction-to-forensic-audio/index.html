Upon performing his investigation, the physician, Antistius, arrived at the conclusion that Caesar had been stabbed a total of 23 times, and that it was the second piercing of the chest that inflicted the fatal blow. Once his analysis was completed, he was asked to present his findings ‘before the forum,’ an archaic version of the court system used across the world today.

The first use of audio analysis was born out of necessity during the First World War when the US- based Bells Labs created a system to identify submarines. Once the war was over, a company named Kay Electric made the product commercially available, and in 1951 trademarked and marketed it as ‘The Sonagraph,’ producing graphs known as ‘Sonograms’ (Vale, 2019).

Audio recordings provide a sequential time record of events as an objective observation, rather than as a witness’ subjective recollection.
