   **Tuesday 8/24:**

   * Me - [Dr. Carson](https://tatecarson.com)
   * Class introductions 
      * Name? Class year? Where are you from? Any idea what forensic audio is?
   * [Syllabus](pages/syllabus.md)
   * [Perusall](https://perusall.com/) signup
        * I will assign readings, videos, or podcasts through Perusall. You will highlight interesting or confusing parts of the material and ask questions. These assignments will be part of your participation grade.  
        * Course code - **CARSON-6A22R**
        * Do the syllabus highlighting by next class.   
   * [Intro to forensics](pages/lectures/week-1/introduction/)   

   Homework: Listen to the Sound Matters Audio Forensics podcast episode and post at least three questions or comments in Perusall.

   **Thursday 8/26**

   * Sound Matters: 26 - Audio Forensics
     * How did [Rob Maher](https://www.montana.edu/rmaher/) define "audio forensics"? 
     * Why is sound forensics probably not the correct name for this field?
     * The crime - Coco is on trial for murder, accused of shooting Bobo. Bobo came home, Coco was waiting for him. Coco claimed he shot at Bobo with a fake clown gun as a joke.
     * Bobo got mad and pulled out a real gun, fired a shot towards Coco but missed and hit Coco's balloon dog. 
     * This caused a popping sound, making Coco think he was shot at. 
     * Coco then pulled out his own gun and fired at Bobo and shot him between the eyes.    
     * At the start of the podcast, did you think Coco was innocent or guilty?
     * How did Dr. Maher describe the process one would go through to analyze this recording?
     * Is it anything like CSI? Why is that show actually damaging to a jury trial? 
     * Why is there still a degree of uncertainty with this field vs another like DNA analysis?
     * Why do most of us not know what guns actually sound like?
     * What are factors that complicate analysis of gunshot recordings, even for people who are very familiar with them? Think about where one listens in relation to the gun.
     * How can reverberations help or hinder the analysis of a sound? 
     * Describe the case that Dr. Maher worked on regarding a police shooting. 
     * What conclusions did we come to about the Coco and Bobo case?
     * What was the frontier of audio forensics that Dr. Maher mentioned towards the end of the podcast?
     * Deep fakes? 
   * Introduction to digital audio  - Authenticity, Enhancement,
and Interpretation - [slides](pages/lectures/week-1/introduction-to-forensic-audio/)
   * Lab: Introduction to Adobe Audition. Download a soundfile from freesound.org and open it in Audition. Use the marquee selection tool to emphasize and de-emphasize parts of the sound.
