The type of encryption used was known as speech scrambling, something which was achieved using a variety of methods (National Defense Research Committee, 1942, 1944b, 1946BIB-023 )</p><p>Once the war was over, a company called Kay Electric was licensed by Bell Labs to develop and manufacture a commercial version of the spectrogram, named the Sono-graph. The device, released in 1951, provided a tool for the visual analysis of recordings, and as such, was an obvious choice of tool for use in audio forensics (Vale, 2019).</p><p>{{/ note %}}</p></section><section><h2 id=united-states-v-mckeever-1958>United States v.

A recording was actually a core piece of evidence. According to court documentation, the defence attempted to impeach evidence from a prosecution witness named George Ball, by claiming he was giving inconsistent evidence, based on earlier recordings made by the defendant of conversations between himself and the witness. George Ball did not recall the discussions, so was permitted by the judge to listen to the recordings on headphones during open court to refresh his memory. Once this listening session had concluded, he stated that he did in fact now remember the conversation, but he did not recognise his own voice and could not remember whether the recording was of the entire conversation. The defence argued that as he recalled the discussion, there should be no need to provide evidence relating to the authenticity of the recording. Unsurprisingly, the prosecution argued that as he did not recognise his own voice and could not recall whether it was the entire conversation, the defence should be required to provide evidence of the accuracy and authenticity of the recording. After reviewing precedents set by other cases, the judge ruled that before an audio recording could be admitted as evidence, its authenticity must be established by providing proof of the following
