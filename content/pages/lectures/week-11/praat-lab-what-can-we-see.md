## Waveform view 

We will be using Praat to analyze speech data. Download and instal it from the link on the schedule page. 

Record your voice speaking vowels into Praat. When you're done recording click "View & Edit" to open. 

Select one of the vowels to see its duration in the menu. Notice the intensity between various vowels by the hight of its waveform. 

Zoom into one of the vowels by selecting it and clicking "sel" in the menu on the bottom of the window. 

Can you tell the difference between the vowels by its waveform? 

## Spectrogram view 

To turn on the spectrogram go to spectrum in the menu and select "show spectrogram". If you are zoomed out too far you won't be able to see anything. Zoom in using "sel" and try again. 

Notice that you can clearly see the formants of the vowels in each spectrogram. You can have praat show you them more clearly by selecting "show formants" in the menu.

Record the word "sea" and open the spectrogram. Notice how the word can be broken into two parts, the "sss" and the "ee" vowel sounds. See the difference in the spectorgram and notice the periodicity and aperiodicity of both parts. Much of the frequency content of the "sss" part may be hidden by Praat. To reveal the rest of the frequency range go to spectrum -> spectrogram settings then increase the view range. 

## Spectral slice 

Record the word sock then open it. Select the mid part of the "aa" vowel, then spectrum -> spectral slice. Zoom in on the visible/audible range of the slice. This is a much more detailed view of the harmonic content of the vowel. Notice the harmonics that are sticking out above the rest. These are your formants.

Do the same for the "ss" sound. Notice if there are more high frequencies or low frequencies. Also notice if the signal is periodic or aperiodic.

Try making a spectrum out of both sounds. It doesn't really work because it combines the two sounds into one.

Finally notice the break in sound between the "aa" vowel and the "kk" consonant. Even though there looks like there is nothing important there this is a very important part of the consonant sound.
