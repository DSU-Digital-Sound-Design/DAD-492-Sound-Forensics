   The history of audio forensics

   **Tuesday 8/31**

   * [slides](pages/lectures/week-2/history-of-audio-forensics/) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-2/history-of-audio-forensics/forensic-audio.pdf)
   * Adobe Audition Lab:
      * [Learn how to make selections using the Time Selection, Marquee Selection, and Lasso Selection tools in Audition to edit audio precisely and add effects. ](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/how-to/audition-make-selections-editing-cc.html?playlist=/services/playlist.helpx/products:SG_AUDITION_1_1/learn-path:get-started/set-header:ccx-designer/playlist:basictraining/en_us.json)

   **Thursday 9/2**

    
   * [Audio forensics beginnings](pages/lectures/week-2/audio-forensic-beginnings/) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-2/audio-forensic-beginnings/forensic-audio-history.pdf)

   Adobe Audition Lab:
   * Review from Tuesday 8/31
      * Make sure you have turned in both the cleaned up audio recording AND the spectrogram screenshot.
      * Exporting files
      * Loop playback 
      * The transient of any sound is the most important to take away, make sure you don't forget it. 
  
   In class: Use the lasso and auto heal selection tools to remove that pesky crow in [this](https://freesound.org/people/dobroide/sounds/580486/) recording. 
   * Select each partial with the lasso tool 
   * then auto heal the selection using command+U
   * use the attenuation knob if necessary
   * again export the file and upload to d2l with a screenshot of the spectrogram.

   HOMEWORK:
   **Read** Chapter 3 History of Audio Forensics from Robert C. Maher's Principles of Forensic Audio Analysis. Write a short summary of each of the cases. 
   
   **Listen and respond** to [Twenty Thousand Hertz - Sound Forensics Podcast](https://www.20k.org/episodes/forensicaudio) which covers some recent cases where audio forensics was used as an important tool.

   **Tuesday 9/7**

   * [Review important cases that used audio forensics](pages/lectures/week-3/historical-cases) 
   * [Twenty Thousand Hertz - Forensic Audio](pages/lectures/week-3/twenty-thousand-hertz)
   * [Forensic Principles slides](pages/lectures/week-3/forensic-principles) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-3/forensic-principles/forensic-principles.pdf)
       

   In Class work: 
   * [Analyze, Normalize, Process](pages/lectures/week-3/lab-instructions)
   * Remove the noise from 3 recordings with broadband constant noise. 
   * HINT: you may need to do the noise reduction multiple times to get different bands of noise. 
      * [Birds and bells](https://freesound.org/people/arnaud%20coutancier/sounds/436032/)
      * [Bagpipes](https://freesound.org/people/Puniho/sounds/172687/) - clean this up as well as you can
      * [Field recording](https://freesound.org/people/833-45/sounds/11727/) - Only remove the hum from the power lines
         * Don't use the deHummer, see how well you can do with just the noise reduction. 
         * Hint: you can zoom in on the frequency display to only find the range of the hum. Try to look up what the hum is in Canada. 
         * Use this [calculator](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-harmonics.htm) to find the odd harmonics of the hum.

   HOMEWORK: 
   
   Read and respond to [This Man Spent Nearly A Year In Prison Over Erroneous AI-Based Evidence](https://hothardware.com/news/man-jailed-over-ai-powered-gunshot-detection)
 

   **Thursday 9/9**

   * Review erroneous AI evidence article 
      * See this more detailed [article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-shotspotter-chicago-man-jailed-20210820-krlg7y2gt5gwxozolqvvslsni4-story.html) from Chicago Tribune

   **In class lab: Sound Remover Tool**

  Remove the cough from the interview, it is really difficult but try several options. Remove the hum from the guitar playing. Remove the rude cell phone ringing during the piano performance. This tool is really useful for removing dynamic prominent sounds. Be sure to look at the presets for help with removing different sounds within different contexts.

   * [Key audio principles](pages/lectures/week-5/key-audio-principles) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-5/key-audio-principles/key-audio-principles.pdf)

   In class lab: use the deReverb tool to remove as much reverb from these recordings as you can. 

   Homework: create a recording under typical forensic audio conditions. On Thursday you will be given a classmates recording and have to identify the non-ideal recording conditions in that recording.

   * Introduction to waveform and spectral analysis 

   Project 4 Due 10/12: 
   1. Create an audio recording with your phone with less than ideal recording conditions. Remember all the different things that can effect the intelligibility of a recording such as other people talking, broadband noise, excessive reverb, strange encodings, or clipping distortion. Include multiple examples to make your recording difficult to understand. Pick a paragraph of text to read from a poem or popular song. This recording will be randomly shared with another classmate. 
   2. Partner up with a classmate and have them email you their recording. Use the tools we have been learning to clean up the recording and make the speech as intelligible as you can. 
   3. Produce a transcript of the speech.
