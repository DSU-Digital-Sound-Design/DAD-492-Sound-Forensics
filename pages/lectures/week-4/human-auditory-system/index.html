In this experiment, the messages were isolated and played independently into the right and left ears. It was found that participants had no problem in isolating one message and rejecting the other. In fact, the extent of rejection of the other speech was so strong that, upon being asked to recall anything heard within the message they rejected, they could provide no information about the words, the semantic content or even the language used.</p><p>Most casework will involve mixed speakers</p></section><section><h2 id=binaural-masking>Binaural masking</h2><ul><li>Binaural masking refers to differences in the signal presented at the left and right ear, although each contains both the target and masking signal.</li><li>Also see<p><a href=https://web.mit.edu/hst.723/www/Labs/BinauralDemos.htm rel=noopener>examples</a></p><ul><li>how many steps of tones do you hear for each example?</li></li></ul></ul><aside class=notes><ul><li>Binaural masking refers to differences in the signal presented at the left and right ear, although each contains both the target and masking signal.</li><li>Research has shown that if the phase of the target signal of a monaural signal is reversed in one ear, the detection threshold reduces by up to 15 dB (Durlach, 1963).</li><li>In everyday life, speech is more easily understood in noise when speech and noise come from different directions, a phenomenon known as &ldquo;spatial release from masking&rdquo;. In this situation, the speech and noise have distinct interaural time differences and interaural level differences. The time differences are produced by the differences in the length of the sound path to the two ears and the level differences are caused by the acoustic shadowing effect of the head.</li><li>As it relates to forensics, this phenomenon demonstrates the advantages of a stereo recording over a single-channel mono recording.</li></ul></section><section><h2 id=informational-masking>Informational masking</h2><aside class=notes><p>Informational masking is defined as perceptual masking which occurs due to the limitations of the human auditory system, such as when the masking sound is highly similar to the desired signal, and the properties of such vary unpredictably (Pollack, 1975).</p><p>Two of the biggest causes of this effect on forensic audio recordings are competing speakers and background music. If the music contains a vocal track, effects are further compounded by the transient nature of music and similarities between voices.</p><p>In the real world (although of no use to forensic examiners), we can overcome informational masking through various cues from differing azimuth, distances, and elevation of the desired speaker and the masker. Freyman et al. (1999) showed that when speakers were separated using loudspeakers at 00 and 600 azimuths in relation to one another, there was a 15–30 per cent improvement in the keywords identified. This is compared to only a 5–10 per cent improvement when the masking speech was changed to noise of the same average spectrum.</p></section><section><h2 id=non-simultaneous-masking>Non-simultaneous masking</h2><img src=temporal-masking.png width=50%><aside class=notes><ul><li>masking can occur before or after a transient sound</li><li>Forward masking is more significant the closer in time to the masker the maskee signal occurs. * The rate of recovery is greater for maskers at higher levels, decaying after 100–200 ms.</li><li>Increases to the masker level do not cause linear increases to the amount of masking. For example, increasing the magnitude of the masker by 10 dB may only increase the masking threshold by 3 dB. This differs from simultaneous masking, at least within a band, where increases in the threshold correspond to linear increases to the signal to masker ratio.</li><li>The amount of masking increases with masker duration up to at least 20 ms. Results differ across studies for longer durations.</li><li>Forward masking is influenced by the relationship between the frequencies of the masker and the maskee (as they are in simultaneous masking).</li></ul></section><section><h2 id=spatial-perception>Spatial perception</h2><img src=Interaural-Time-Difference-ITD-and-Interaural-Level-Difference-ILD.png width=60%><aside class=notes><ul><li>How can we tell where a sound is coming from?</li><li>The two best-known techniques are the Interaural Intensity Difference (IID), also known as the Interaural Level Difference (ILD), when measured in dB, and the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) (Si, 2016).</li><li>ITD - If we consider a sound source located 10 metres in front and 10 metres to the right of us, the sound will have to travel further to reach the left ear, and so will arrive slightly delayed in comparison to the signal at the right ear.
