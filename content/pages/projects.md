## Final Project 

give them a random recording of a crime and have them make a profile of the person on the recording, what is their possible age, sex, medical condition etc? Also, do a gunshot analysis on the recording. Is the recording authentic? How do you know? 

Resources: 

* [IPA Chart with audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio) - Listen to the vowels and just copy them from here instead of trying to find them in the Praat menu. 

### Speaker profiling 

Build your own database out of the speechbox database and enter it into visible vowels. Use this to determine all you can about the unknown speaker. compare the recording with other recordings of known people, with known age, gender regional accent. Submit your process for gather and formatting the data,  the charts used to do the comparisons as well as the data used to create each of those charts. The unknown speaker should be a long recording that they need to annotate and clean up. Should they also have to look for edits?
