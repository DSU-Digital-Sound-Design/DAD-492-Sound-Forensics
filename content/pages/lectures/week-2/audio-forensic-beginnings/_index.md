## The Spectrogram 

![](early-spectrogram.png)

{{% note %}}
Audio recordings provided the ability to do some sort of analysis on sound, but it wasn't until the spectrogram was invented that the analysis became more useful. 

* First demonstrated to  National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) representatives in 1941
* It was originally used to study encryption and decryption of confidential voice transmissions
* This could include different types speech scrambling
* Later Kay Electric developed and manufactured a commerical version called the Sono-gram in 1951

According to one report, the spectrogram was first demonstrated to National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) representatives in 1941, resulting in Project C-43 being organised to provide a spectrogram to decipher speech and sounds visually, although the top priority was the study of encryption and decryption of confidential voice transmissions (National Defense Research Committee, 1944a). The type of encryption used was known as speech scrambling, something which was achieved using a variety of methods (National Defense Research Committee, 1942, 1944b, 1946BIB-023 )

Once the war was over, a company called Kay Electric was licensed by Bell Labs to develop and manufacture a commercial version of the spectrogram, named the Sono-graph. The device, released in 1951, provided a tool for the visual analysis of recordings, and as such, was an obvious choice of tool for use in audio forensics (Vale, 2019).

## United States v. McKeever (1958)

* George Ball was a prosecution witness that the defense claimed was giving inconsistant evidence. 
* Ball had discussions with the witness that were recorded 
* He was able to listen to the recordings to jog his memory 
* He was able to remember the conversation, but didn't recognize his own voice 
* The just ruled that the recording needed to be proven authentic

The first time a criminal case had an audio recording presented as evidence. A recording was actually a core piece of evidence.  According to court documentation, the defence attempted to impeach evidence from a prosecution witness named George Ball, by claiming he was giving inconsistent evidence, based on earlier recordings made by the defendant of conversations between himself and the witness. George Ball did not recall the discussions, so was permitted by the judge to listen to the recordings on headphones during open court to refresh his memory. Once this listening session had concluded, he stated that he did in fact now remember the conversation, but he did not recognise his own voice and could not remember whether the recording was of the entire conversation. The defence argued that as he recalled the discussion, there should be no need to provide evidence relating to the authenticity of the recording. Unsurprisingly, the prosecution argued that as he did not recognise his own voice and could not recall whether it was the entire conversation, the defence should be required to provide evidence of the accuracy and authenticity of the recording. After reviewing precedents set by other cases, the judge ruled that before an audio recording could be admitted as evidence, its authenticity must be established by providing proof of the following

### Seven Tenets of Audio Authenticity 

1. The recording device was capable of capturing the conversation now offered in evidence. 
2. The operator of the device was competent to operate the device. 
3. The recording is authentic and correct.
4. Changes, additions, or deletions have not been made in the recording.
5. The recording has been preserved in a manner that is shown to the court.
6. The speakers are identified.
7. The conversation elicited was made voluntarily and in good faith, without any kind of inducement.

These are known as the Seven Tenets of Audio Authenticity 

The evidence that was admissable was actually a transcript of the recording rather than the recording itself. This case propelled the FBI to start training its own audio forensics experts.
