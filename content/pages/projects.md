## Project 1

## Project 2

## Project 3 

## Final Project 

Here are the unknown speakers. Pick the one that corresponds to your last name. Annotate at least 3 minutes of the recording. 

1. A - G - [speaker 1](pages/project-audio/unknown%20speaker-001.mp3)
2. H - O - [speaker 2](pages/project-audio/unknown%20speaker-002.mp3)
3. O - Z - [speaker 3](pages/project-audio/unknown%20speaker-003.mp3)


The previous tutorials have taught you how to load a corpus into Visible Vowels and analyze the data. For the final project you will load a corpus of audio containing all of the available ALLSTAR recordings: read speech HT1 and HT2; spontaneous speech ST1 and ST2.  

Because the ALLSTAR corpus metadata provides the city where the participant was born and not the region we must organize these cities into linguistic regions so they can be compared to each other. Follow the catagories from [this map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English#Varieties) from Wikipedia. For instance, change Troy^MI^USA to inland-north. 

Your unknown speaker recording has been recorded in everyday conditions. This means you must clean up the recording with Adobe Audition using the techniques we've learned in class. After restoring the recording analyze it with Praat and the extracted forments of the speaker to  your corpus spreadsheet. The metadata of the unknown speaker should be labeled as unknown except for the age column, which must be a number.  

Go through the [Visible Vowels tutorial](https://fryske-akademy.nl/fa-apps/tutorial/) again, but now with your generated corpus. Use it to generate diagrams that you will use to create a profile of the unknown speaker based on the similarity to different dimensions of the corpus. For instance, what region do you think the speaker is from? What gender is the speaker? If some regions are too similar to tell apart, describe which regions the speaker is NOT from. Narrowing down the possibilities in an investigation can be important if a definitive match cannot be found. 

Hint: Try to only compare one unknown variable at a time. Figure out what region the speaker is from first then move onto the other dimensions. If you guess that the speaker is from a region, enter that into the spreadsheet and now you will be able to compare different dimensions such as gender or race to the unknown speaker more easily because you know the region. 

Turn in: 

* a word document with the diagrams from Visible Vowels along with your interpretation of the diagrams. With the diagrams included it should be at least 2 pages.  
    * In the profile attempt a conclusion on the unknown speaker with the following criteria:
        * What region do you think the speaker is from?
        * Is the speaker male or female 
        * What is the age range of the speaker?   
* the CSV file you loaded into Visible Vowels.
* The cleaned up unknown speaker recording
* the annotated TextGrid of the unknown speaker
