### Edouard-Léon Scott de Martinville's Phonautograph - 1860

Hear the [sounds](http://www.firstsounds.org/sounds/scott.php)

{{% note %}}
Thomas Edison is widely regarded as a pioneer in the field of audio creating the first method of recording. Edison’s phonograph was the first machine to both record sounds and play them back. 

But actually the first capture of sound is documented as the 10-second recording of a folk singer on the 9th of April 1860, in France. he device was named the Phonoautograph and consisted of a barrel-shaped horn attached to a stylus. The movement of the horn, and thus, the stylus, etched sound waves onto sheets of blackened paper which had previously been exposed to oil lamp smoke. Designed by Parisian Edouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, it was his intention to capture a visual representation of human speech that could be deciphered at a later date (Brock- Nannestad and Fontaine, 2008), and for around 150 years the sounds remained trapped on the blackened paper But with new technology comes new solutions, and in 2008 scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, USA, used optical imaging on the high-resolution scans of the captures, and the first recorded sound was finally replayed (Rosen, 2008).

14th of February 1876, when Alexander Graham Bell, in his laboratory in Boston, MA, used a diaphragm attached to an electromagnet to act as a transducer and convert acoustic waveforms hitting the diaphragm into electrical variations. The speech was extremely faint, but audible none the less (Clark, 1993). He called his new device the ‘telephone’ after the word ‘telephony’ (which was already an established term by this time).

### Edison's phonograph - 1877

{{% note %}}

A year later and upon hearing of Bell’s device, Thomas Edison took this idea one step further with the intention of transmitting messages using this new technique. Using a stylus attached to the telephone microphone, he was able to create grooves representative of the movement of the sound waves on paraffin- coated paper by using an electromagnetic as a transducer (Figure 2.1). He discovered that reversing this process by running the stylus over the grooves moved the connected electromagnet, and thus the diaphragm. The diaphragm movement then moved the surrounding particles of air, reproducing the previously captured sound waves of the nursery rhyme ‘Mary had a little lamb.’ He named his device the ‘Phonograph’ (Bouchard, 2012; Wile, 1982). The concept of reversing the capture process for playback remains the foundation of all audio systems to this day.

Photos of a replica 1877 cylinder tinfoil phonograph: Invented by Thomas Edison and built by John Kruesi in Menlo Park, New Jersey in December 1877. This machine is a replica, built by William Miller in 2011. It is based on the original artifact, which is preserved at Thomas Edison National Historical Park. The replica mouthpiece, built in 2017 by Anton Stoelwinder, and replica horn are based on historic drawings.

## Graphophone - 1886 - Bell

![](Graphophone1901.jpg)

{{% note %}}
Improving on the work of edison  Bell picked up on the work of his rival and swapped the stylus for a chisel-shaped cutter to leave deeper, and thus cleaner grooves. This resulted in a more intelligible sound with lower background noise. He named his device the ‘Graphophone’ in his 1886 patent (Newville, 1959).

Edison didn't want to work with Bell, so he decided to create his own cylinder phonograph. This time he decided to use electric motor- driven disks instead of the hand-cranked rotating cylinder he had used previously for movement of the paraffin-coated material and he named his new 1898 device the ‘Gramophone’ (Collins and Gitelman, 2002).

 described the separation of the carrier from the memory coating in a flat information medium in a 1900 patent, an observation which went on to form the basis of magnetic tape (Poulsen, 1900). He also recognised that the signal captured on a tape does not correspond to the recording current but is distorted, and in 1907 he proposed the addition of a DC current to the signal, a technique known as ‘biasing.’

## E.C. Wente - Bell Telephone Labs

{{% note %}}
E.C. Wente, of Bell Telephone Labs, published a research article (Wente, 1917) describing a uniforming sensitive instrument for the ‘absolute measurement of sound intensity,’ named ‘the condenser microphone.’ Although initially designed for long-line telephone transmission during the USA’s development of a transcontinental telephone service, its remarkable acoustic performance lent it to the recording process (Mayfield and Harrison, 1926).
